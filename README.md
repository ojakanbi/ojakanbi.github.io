### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics that were discussed in the lab were really helpful when coding this flixster project. Especially learning about the forms and the DOM.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have added some more stretch features and made the CSS a little better 

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo to the class was great, especially when I was the one that presented to the cohort first. I liked it for the main fact that my peers were able to tell me my glows and my grows.
